 # TikTok_Analysis_Project
Scraping data from social media allows us to measure audience (and, occasionally, bot..) behavior objectively and at scale rather than relying solely on self-report from smaller interviews/focus groups or surveys. The project undertaken analyses scraped data from Tik Tok social media platform and visualizes insights discovered using machine learning algorithms.
